# Isometric Game
This is a work in progress C++ game written from scratch.  Game idea is inspired by titles such as Fire Emblem.  The main goal is to be
a turn based game in which the player fields a troop of different units and fights in varying scenarios.  As a WIP, scope of the project can change.
It currently exists as a barebones project to find programming challenges common in game development then employing solutions.
